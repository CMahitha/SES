                                           <span> Contributions </span>: commonly known as Mahatma Gandhi,he played a pivotal 
                                            role in India's struggle for independence from British colonial rule through 
                                            nonviolent civil disobedience and passive resistance. Gandhi's philosophy 
                                            of Satyagraha, or truth force, emphasized the power of moral and spiritual 
                                            strength in the face of injustice. His iconic methods of protest, such as salt 
                                            marches and fasting, inspired movements worldwide. Gandhi's life was 
                                            dedicated to social justice, equality, and communal harmony, and his efforts 
                                            ultimately contributed to India's independence in 1947. His legacy as a 
                                            symbol of peace and change endures.<br>

                                            role in the nonviolent freedom movement. Nehru was a staunch advocate of

                                                    <span>Contributions : </span>Rani Lakshmi Bai of Jhansi was a fearless warrior and a 
                                            symbol of Indian resistance against British colonialism during the Indian 
                                            Rebellion of 1857. Widowed at a young age, she became the Queen of the 
                                            princely state of Jhansi and a passionate advocate for her people's rights. 
                                            When the Indian Rebellion erupted, Rani Lakshmi Bai displayed 
                                            exceptional valor, leading her troops into battle dressed as a warrior, her 
                                            young son strapped to her back. Her heroism and leadership made her an 
                                            enduring symbol of Indian nationalism. She fought fiercely but tragically 
                                            died in battle in 1858. Rani Lakshmi Bai's legacy as the "Warrior Queen" 
                                            endures as a symbol of Indian valor and the struggle for independence.<br>

                                            <span>Contributions :</span> Aruna Asaf Ali,was a remarkable Indian freedom fighter 
                                            and a prominent figure in the struggle for independence. She played a 
                                            pivotal role in various civil disobedience movements against British rule 
                                            and was an ardent supporter of Mahatma Gandhi's principles. Her courage 
                                            shone during the Quit India Movement of 1942, when she hoisted the 
                                            Indian National Congress flag at the Bombay (now Mumbai) Gowalia Tank 
                                            Maidan, an act of defiance that galvanized the nation's resolve. Aruna Asaf
                                            Ali was a symbol of women's participation in India's freedom struggle and

                                          the time), Kumaran didn’t leave the premises. The British cops went down 
                                          hard. They started thrashing all the protestors, and Kumaran was caught in 
                                          the beatings. Though he succumbed to injuries, he was found dead holding

                                        oppression. Bomman and his followers, known as the "Marudu Pandiyar
                                        brothers," waged a relentless struggle for independence. 
                                        Though Bomman's rebellion was ultimately suppressed, his unwavering 
                                        courage and commitment to the cause left an enduring legacy in the annals 
                                        of Indian history, inspiring future generations in their fight for freedom. His

                                      collection of poems, "Gitanjali" (Song Offerings). Tagore's literary works 
                                      explored themes of spirituality, humanism, and the interconnectedness of

                                        India Company's army. In 1857, he became a symbol of resistance when he 
                                        rebelled against the British for introducing the Enfield rifle, the 
                                        ammunition of which was rumored to be greased with animal fat, causing 
                                        religious offense. On March 29, 1857, he fired the first shot of what would 
                                        become the Indian Rebellion of 1857. Though Pandey was eventually 
                                        captured and executed, his actions ignited a widespread uprising against

                                        <span>Contributions :</span> Subhas Chandra Bose, also known as Netaji, was a 
                                    charismatic Indian nationalist leader.A fervent believer in complete 
                                    independence for India, he played a pivotal role in the freedom movement. 
                                    Bose's leadership extended to his formation of the Azad Hind Fauj (Indian 
                                    National Army) during World War II, with the famous slogan "Give me 
                                    blood, and I will give you freedom." His military campaign alongside 
                                    Japanese forces against British India left an indelible mark. Even his 
                                    mysterious death in 1945 remains a subject of intrigue. Subhas Chandra 
                                    Bose's undying spirit and resolute commitment to India's cause continue to 
                                    inspire the nation and serve as a symbol of unyielding patriotism..<br>

                                    first woman to serve as India's Prime Minister. She held office from 1966 to 
                                    1977 and then again from 1980 until her assassination in 1984. As the daughter 
                                    of Jawaharlal Nehru, India's first Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi played a 
                                    pivotal role in the nation's political landscape. Her leadership saw significant 
                                    developments, including the successful 1971 war with Pakistan that led to the 
                                    creation of Bangladesh. However, her tenure was marred by authoritarianism 
                                    during the Emergency period from 1975 to 1977. Indira Gandhi's legacy is 
                                    marked by both accomplishments and controversies, and she remains a 
                                    polarizing figure in Indian politics.<br>

                    	<span>Contributions : </span> Sri Aurobindo Ghosh was a philosopher, yogi,
                     and visionary leader in India's struggle for independence. A prominent 
                     freedom fighter in his early life, he later turned to spiritual exploration 
                     and the development of Integral Yoga. Sri Aurobindo emphasized the evolution 
                     of human consciousness and the realization of the divine within. His spiritual
                      teachings and writings, including "The Life Divine" and "Savitri," left an 
                      indelible mark on the world of philosophy and spirituality. He established 
                      the Sri AurobindoAshram in Puducherry, where his teachings continue to guide 
                      countless seekers on their path to inner transformation and selfrealization. 
                      Sri Aurobindo's legacy endures as a source of inspiration and spiritual wisdom.

                     advocate for Indian self-rule and is renowned for his work "Poverty and Un-British Rule in India," 
                     which exposed the economic exploitation of India by British colonialism. His theories on the drain 
                     of wealth from India became central to the understanding of British exploitation. Dadabhai Naoroji's
